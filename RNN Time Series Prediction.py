M4 Assignment-1: RNN for Time Series Prediction.
This assignment is based on the Time Series Prediction lab 10.9.6 from ISLP Chapter 10.
Please use the textbook lab as a reference.
Note that the textbook lab is written using PyTorch.
You should write your model using Tensorflow.
The goal is to predict log_volume using lagged data.

Step 1: Load & Prep Dataframes
Load the NYSE dataset from the NYSE.csv file available in the file tree to the left.
The date column gives you the timestamps of the time Series.
The train column indicates True for records to be used in the train set, and False for those to be used in the test set.
For this step, let's keep only these 3 columns: 'DJ_return', 'log_volume', 'log_volatility'
Standardize all 3 columns using ScikitLearn's StandardScaler.
In the starter code given below:
  - cols is a list of the names of these 3 columns.
  - X is a dataframe that contains only these 3 columns from NYSE.csv.
**Q4-1-0 Print "0. the shape of datafrmae X: xxx" - Replace xxx with the proper value
**Q4-1-1 Print "1. the first record of dataframe X: xxx" - Replace xxx with proper values

Use code from the textbook lab to set up lagged versions of these 3 data columns (using the starter code given to you here.)

Create the Y response target using the 'log_volume' column from dataframe X.
Extract the 'train' column from dataframe X as a separate variable called train. Drop the 'train' column from dataframe X.
Later on we will use the train variable to split the dataset into train vs. test.
Drop the current dayâ€™s DJ_return (the "DJ_return" column) and log_volatility from dataframe X.
- Current day refers to the non-lagged columns of these two variables. 
- In other words, remove these two X features, and also the Y response that came from dataframe X.

To fit the RNN, we must reshape the X dataframe, as the RNN layer will expect 5 lagged versions of each feature as indicated by the (5,3) shape of the RNN layer below. 
We first ensure the columns of our X dataframe are such that a reshaped matrix will have the variables correctly lagged. 
We use the reindex() method to do this. 
The RNN layer also expects the first row of each observation to be earliest in time..
So we must reverse the current order.
Follow the textbook lab code to reorder/reindex the columns properly.
**Q4-1-9: Print "9. the first 3 records of X after reindexing: xxx" - Replace xxx with proper values.

Reshape dataframe X as a 3-D Numpy array such that each record/row has the shape of (5,3). Each row represents a lagged version of the 3 variables in the shape of (5,3).

Now we are ready for RNN modeling.
Set up your X_train, X_test, Y_train, and Y_test using the X dataframe, Y response target, and the train variable you have created above.
Include records where train = True in the train set, and train = False in the test set.
Configure a Keras Sequential model with
(1) proper input shape,
(2) SimpleRNN layer with 12 hidden units, the relu activation function, and 10% dropout
(3) a proper output layer.
Do not name the model or any of the layers.
